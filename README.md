# capstone-3

The intent behind our capstone project is to create a microblogging website through collaborative methods as opposed to working independently. We have had practice with the github workflow to allow everyone to obtain a better understanding of how to cooperate with each other's code.

Our landing page uses a minimalist design when welcoming the user to the login page.

The page uses a button to use an alert to provide a brief paragraph for the user to learn more about the website. One edge case that we have with the alert button would log the user in assuming they already have the correct username and password filled out in the input field.

Our registration page uses a form and emulates similar common layouts seen for other services. It uses a fetch and "POST" method to allow the user to create an account that would be saved to the list in the API database. Some issues we had during the process of creation for this page included understanding how the authorization works and if it was needed to POST a new profile object to the API. We've come to learnt hat authorization is not needed for this project. The form also implements error messages to explain which areas of the form are incomplete and are requierd to be filled out.
