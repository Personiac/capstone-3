# capstone-3

The intent behind our capstone project is to create a microblogging website through collaborative methods as opposed to working independently. We have had practice with the github workflow to allow everyone to obtain a better understanding of how to cooperate with each other's code.

Our landing page uses a minimalist design when welcoming the user to the login page. The page uses a button to use an alert to provide a brief paragraph for the user to learn more about the website.
